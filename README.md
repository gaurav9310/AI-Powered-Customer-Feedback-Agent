# AI-Powered-Customer-Feedback-Agent
This project is an AI-powered automated customer feedback system built using n8n and integrated with **Groq** **AI**, **Airtable**,**Slack**, and **Gmail.** 
It captures user feedback from a form, classifies it using a large language model, and routes it based on the sentiment or intent.  
**Tools Used:**
-> Form: Captures feedback from users and triggers the workflow.
-> Groq AI: Analyzes the message and classifies it as a complaint, compliment, or feature request.
-> Merge: Combines form input and AI output for unified processing.
-> Switch: Routes feedback to the appropriate branch based on classification.
-> Airtable: Stores feedback in respective sheets (Complaint, Compliment, Feature Request).
-> Slack: Sends real-time alerts to internal teams for faster action.
-> Gmail: Sends emails to notify or acknowledge responses.  
This system reduces manual workload, ensures timely responses, and improves support quality using AI automationâ€”all with a no-code approach.
